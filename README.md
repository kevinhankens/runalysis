# Runalysis

![Runalysis Screenshot](media/images/runalysis_course.jpeg)

Runalysis is a basic running app for iOS written in Swift. The intent is to not focus on /where/ you went, but rather /how/ it went. I am a runner and I wrote this as a way to learn iOS and Swift, and hopefully others will be able to use what I have learned :)

It allows you to schedule workouts on a weekly basis to quickly see your history and upcoming schedule.

Instead of displaying your run on a map, it displays your course using colors corresponding with your velocity. This gives a quick visual understanding of how consistent your run was. It also displays simple graphs that can be used to visualize metrics like altitude and velocity.

## Goals

The goal is to eventually provide an easy-to-digest view of your workout. There are several features that would help make this an even more useful training tool.
- Incorporate methods to adjust velocity with respect to gradient
- Analyze consistency in stride count
- Track and analyze heartrate
- Export your workouts so that you can incoporate with other services
